						<h3>Starbuzz meets social media</h3>
						<time datetime="2018-09-08">September 8, 2018</time>
						</header>
						<p>Here at starbuzz we're embracing the social media craze. Infact, we're going further than any of our competitors and we're very close..</p>
						<p>Sound like science fiction? It's not; I'm already testing our final prototype social network cup as I write this..</p>
						<p>So, keep your eyes out of this amazing new cup. And I'll be releasing a video teaser soon to tell you all about this new invention, straight from Starbuzz Coffee.</p>

						<h3>Starbuzz uses computer science</h3>
						<time datetime="2018-09-01">September 1, 2018</time>
						</header>
						<p>Have you ever asked how efficient Starbuzz Coffee House is? The lines always move fast, and despite the astronomical number of different drinks any customer can order, we have your drink up, hot (or cold if that's the way you want it) and ready in seconds. How do we do it? </p>
						<p>To pull this off, we take advantage of the latest and greatest in computer science. In facet, we train our staff to be one big distributed computer. The cashiers create the orders for the distributed computer, complete with your name and the drinks special instructions.</p>
						<p>With this design, we are able to horizontally scale our operation any time we want. All we need to do is add more cashiers and drink makers (not to mention a fair amount of support staff you never see) as the customer flow grows.
